# Task 9: Reverse Analysis of Even Numbers

You work in a scientific lab where experiments generate lists of integers.  
Your task is to help researchers extract even numbers from a list and display them **in reverse order** — without using any built-in reverse tools.

## 💡 Task Description

Write a program that:

- Takes a predefined list of integers (representing experiment results).
- Prints only the **even numbers**, in **reverse order**.
- Does **not** use additional lists, built-in reversing tools, or slicing.

## 🚫 Restrictions

The following are **not allowed**:

- `reverse()` method  
- `reversed()` function  
- Slicing like `list[::-1]`  
- Creating a new list to store reversed values  

## 🧾 Example
```markdown
Original list: [10, 5, 8, 13, 2, 7]

Output:
2 8 10
```

## ✅ Requirements

- No additional lists allowed.
- Must use in-place operations or reverse iteration.
- Output must contain only even numbers, each on a new line.
- Variable names should be descriptive and self-explanatory.

## 📌 Topics Covered

- Loops and indexing  
- Conditional statements (`if`)  
- In-place operations  
- Iteration control
