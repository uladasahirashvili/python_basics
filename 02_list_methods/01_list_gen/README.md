# Task 1: List Generation

This Python program takes an integer input `N` and generates a list of all odd numbers from 1 to `N` (inclusive).  
It's a simple practice of working with loops, conditionals, and lists.

## 💡 Task Description

## 🧾 Example

Enter a number: 14

List of odd numbers from 1 to N: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]


## ✅ Requirements

- The input prompt should be user-friendly.
- Output format must match the examples.
- Variable names should be meaningful and self-explanatory.

## 📌 Topics Covered

- `for` loops
- Conditional statements (`if`)
- List operations
