# Task 3: Graphics Card Filter

This Python program processes a list of NVIDIA graphics card model numbers.  
It removes **all entries of the highest model** from the list, simulating a situation where the most powerful cards quickly sold out.

## üí° Task Description

Write a program that:

- Asks the user to enter the number of graphics cards.
- Then prompts for each model number.
- Creates a list of all models **except the highest one** (i.e. removes all maximum values).
- Prints both the original and the filtered list.

## üßæ Example

```bash
  Number of graphics cards: 5
Card 1: 3070
Card 2: 2060
Card 3: 3090
Card 4: 3070
Card 5: 3090

Old list of graphics cards: [3070, 2060, 3090, 3070, 3090]
New list of graphics cards: [3070, 2060, 3070]

```

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- Input prompts should be user-friendly and numbered.
- Output format must match the example.
- Variable names must be meaningful and descriptive.

## üìå Topics Covered

- `for` loops  
- Conditional statements (`if`)  
- List operations  
- `max()` function (can be used for optimization)
