# Task 6: Scrolling Digits

This task simulates a small digital board (like those in subways or buses) that continuously scrolls a sequence of numbers or text in a loop.

## ðŸ’¡ Task Description

You're given:
- A list of integers.
- A positive integer `K` (the number of positions to shift).

The task is to shift the list **to the right** by `K` positions **cyclically**, using as few assignment operations as possible.

### Example 1
```markdown
Shift: 1
Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Shifted list: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```
### Example 2
```markdown
Shift: 3
Original list: [1, 4, -3, 0, 10]
Shifted list: [-3, 0, 10, 1, 4]
```

## âœ… Requirements

- Input must include prompts, matching the examples.
- Use meaningful variable names (no a, b, c...).
- The result must be printed in the format shown.
- Efficient memory use: avoid unnecessary reassignment.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered

- List slicing
- Modulo for rotation
- Input parsing
- Memory-efficient coding

ðŸŒ€ Keep the digits spinning!
