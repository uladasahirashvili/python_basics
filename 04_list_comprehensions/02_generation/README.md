# ðŸ”¢ Task 6: Patterned List Generator
Youâ€™ve been asked to write a quick utility function for a backend developer who needs to generate a custom list of numbers. The twist? The values arenâ€™t added directly â€” they depend on their position in the list.

Time to show off those Python list comprehension skills ðŸ§ ðŸ’¥

## âœ… Task
Write a program that:

- Asks the user to input an integer N

- Creates a list of length N, using the following rules:

- If the index is even (including zero), insert the number 1

- If the index is odd, insert the original number modulo 5 (number % 5)

- Output the resulting list

- The entire logic must be implemented using a list comprehension â€” thatâ€™s the challenge ðŸ’ª

## ðŸ§ª Example
```markdown
Enter the list length: 10  
Result: [1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 4]
```
## âœ… Requirements
- Use a list comprehension (one-liner)

- Index-based logic must be correct

- The output format must match the example

- All variable names should be meaningful

- User input must be clearly prompted

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered
- List comprehensions

- Conditional expressions

- Input handling

- Modulo operations

- Index-based logic

ðŸŽ¯ A perfect task to master one-liners, practice control flow inside list generation, and write clean, Pythonic code.
