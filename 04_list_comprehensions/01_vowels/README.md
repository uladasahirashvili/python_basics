# 🔤 Task 5: Vowel Extractor
A team of linguists is working on a new text analyzer and they love the quality of your Python code. They've asked you to create a function that extracts vowels from a given English sentence and counts how many there are.

Let’s make that happen — one vowel at a time 🗣️📊

## ✅ Task
Write a program that:

- Asks the user to enter a line of English text

- Builds a list of all vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from that text

- Prints the list of vowels

- Prints how many vowels were found in total

## 🧪 Example
```markdown
Enter your text: We must destroy the ring!

Vowel list: ['e', 'u', 'e', 'o', 'e', 'i']
Total vowels: 6
```

## ✅ Requirements
- Only vowels should be included in the output list (a, e, i, o, u — case-insensitive)

- Output format must match the example

- Variable and function names should be clear and descriptive

- The program should handle both lowercase and uppercase input gracefully

## 📌 Topics Covered
- String processing

- Lists and loops

- Input/output formatting

- Case normalization (.lower())
