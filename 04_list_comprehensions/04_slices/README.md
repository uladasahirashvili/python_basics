# ✂️ Task 8: Mastering String Slices
Get ready to flex your Python slicing muscles! Given a string of the first seven letters of the English alphabet, your task is to produce 10 different slice outputs using only the print function and slicing syntax.

This is perfect practice for mastering one of Python’s most useful features — string slicing 🐍✨

## ✅ Task
You have this string:
```python
alphabet = 'abcdefg'
```
Write a program that prints these 10 results (exactly in this order):

1. The full string (copy)

2. The string reversed

3. Every second character starting from the first (a, c, e, g)

4. Every second character starting from the second (b, d, f)

5. All characters up to the second index (not including index 2)

6. All characters from the end to the second last (negative slicing)

7. Characters from index 3 up to (but not including) index 4

8. The last three characters

9. Characters from index 3 up to (but not including) index 5

10. Same as previous, but reversed

## 🧪 Expected Output
```markdown
abcdefg
gfedcba
aceg
bdf
ab
g
d
efg
de
ed
```

## ✅ Requirements
- Use only the print() function and slicing expressions on alphabet

- Output format must match the example exactly

- No other variables or loops — just straightforward slicing

- Understand positive and negative indices, step values

## 📌 Topics Covered
- String slicing

- Indexing basics

- Negative indices and reverse slicing

- Step values in slices
