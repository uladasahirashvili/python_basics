# 🧾 Task 1: Restaurant Menu Formatter
A European restaurant needs a simple script that displays their menu in a clean and customer-friendly format. Right now, their internal website stores the menu as a long lowercase string, where each dish is separated by a semicolon. Not very elegant, right?

They've asked you to fix that — and make it look classy 🍽️✨

## ✅ Task
Write a program that:

- Accepts a string of dish names written in lowercase and separated by semicolons (;)

- Formats each dish name to start with a capital letter

- Joins the names with a comma and a space (, )

- Outputs the cleaned-up menu in one friendly line

## 🧪 Example
 ```markdown
Today's menu: duck breast;flank steak;apple tart;risotto  
We currently have: Duck Breast, Flank Steak, Apple Tart, Risotto
```
## ✅ Requirements
- Capitalize the first letter of each word in a dish name

- Output must match the formatting of the example exactly

- Variable names should be clear and self-explanatory

- Keep the code clean, readable, and beginner-friendly

## 🧰 Input Sample
```python
menu_input = "duck breast;flank steak;apple tart;risotto"
```
## 📌 Topics Covered
- String manipulation

- Input/output formatting

- Basic list operations

- Capitalization in Python

---
✨ Turn that plain text menu into something worthy of a Michelin star!
