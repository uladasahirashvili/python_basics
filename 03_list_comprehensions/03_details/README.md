# 🛠️ Task 3: Shop Inventory Tracker

A small hardware store keeps track of parts and their prices using a very simple system — just a list of lists. But counting how many items they have and summing their total price manually? That’s getting really annoying.

Time to bring in a little Python magic and make that process smoother ✨

## ✅ Task
Write a program that:

- Asks the user for the name of a part

- Counts how many times it appears in the shop inventory

- Calculates the total cost of all those parts

## 🧪 Example
```markdown
Part name: seat  
Number of parts — 3  
Total cost — 4500
```
## 🧰 Data Sample
```python
shop = [
    ['bottom bracket', 60],   
    ['crank arm', 50],        
    ['saddle', 15],     
    ['pedal', 5],              
    ['saddle', 75],          
    ['frame', 600],            
    ['rim', 100],             
    ['crank arm', 10],        
    ['saddle', 135],
]
```
## ✅ Requirements
- The program should handle user input with clear prompts

- Counting and summing must be correct

- Output formatting should match the example exactly

- Use meaningful variable names (no single-letter names like a, b, c)

- Avoid unnecessary complexity — keep the code clean and readable

## 📌 Topics Covered
- Nested lists

- Input/output formatting

- Iteration and conditionals

- Summation and counting logic
