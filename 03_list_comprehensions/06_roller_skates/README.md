# Task 6: Roller Skates Rental
A private rental shop offers roller skates in various sizes.
Each person can only wear skates that perfectly fit their foot size.

## âœ… What You Need to Do
- The user inputs two lists:

- N sizes of available roller skates

- K foot sizes of people who want to rent skates

- Write a program to determine the maximum number of people who can simultaneously rent skates that fit them.

Remember:

- One pair of skates can only be used by one person.

- One person can only wear one pair of skates.

## ðŸ§ª Example
```markdown
Number of skates: 4
Size of skate 1: 41
Size of skate 2: 40
Size of skate 3: 39
Size of skate 4: 42

Number of people: 3
Foot size of person 1: 42
Foot size of person 2: 41
Foot size of person 3: 42

Maximum number of people who can rent skates: 2
```
## âœ… Requirements
- Correctly calculate the maximum matches between skates and foot sizes.

- Inputs must have clear prompts matching the example.

- Output format must match the example exactly.

- Use meaningful variable names (no random single letters).


## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered
- Lists and matching elements

- User input handling

- Greedy matching logic

- Loops and conditions

Get everyone rolling with perfectly fitting skates! ðŸ›¼âœ¨
