# Smallest Divisor (excluding 1)

## Description

Write a function that takes a natural number `n > 1` and finds its smallest divisor greater than 1.

## Example

Input:
Enter a natural number greater than 1: 6

Output:
The smallest divisor greater than 1 is: 2

Input:
Enter a natural number greater than 1: 17

Output:
The smallest divisor greater than 1 is: 17


## Evaluation Criteria

- The result is correct for all inputs `n > 1`.
- The input prompt is user-friendly.
- The output matches the required format.
- The main logic is implemented inside a dedicated function.
- Variables and functions have meaningful names.

## How to Use

1. Run the script.
2. Enter a natural number greater than 1 when prompted.
3. The program will display the smallest divisor of the number greater than 1.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
