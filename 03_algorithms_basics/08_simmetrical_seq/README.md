# Task 8: Symmetric Sequence
A sequence of numbers is called symmetric if it reads the same forwards and backwards.
For example, these sequences are symmetric:
```markdown
1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1  
1 2 1 2 2 1 2 1
```
## ✅ What You Need to Do
The user inputs a sequence of N numbers.

Write a program that determines:

- The minimum number of numbers that need to be appended to the end of the sequence to make it symmetric.

- The actual numbers that should be appended.

## 🧪 Examples
### Example 1
```markdown
Number of elements: 5
Number 1: 1
Number 2: 2
Number 3: 1
Number 4: 2
Number 5: 2

Sequence: [1, 2, 1, 2, 2]
Numbers to append: 3
Numbers themselves: [1, 2, 1]
```
### Example 2
```markdown
Number of elements: 5
Number 1: 1
Number 2: 2
Number 3: 3
Number 4: 4
Number 5: 5

Sequence: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Numbers to append: 4
Numbers themselves: [4, 3, 2, 1]
```
## ✅ Requirements
- Correctly compute the minimal number and the list of numbers to append.

- Input prompts must be clear and follow the example format.

- Output formatting must exactly match the examples.

- Use meaningful variable names (no random letters).

## 📌 Topics Covered
- Lists and sequences

- String/list reversal and comparison

- Loops and conditions

- Algorithmic thinking to find minimal extension
