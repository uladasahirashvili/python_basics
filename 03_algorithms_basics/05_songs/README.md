# Task 5: Depeche Mode Songs Playlist
We're building a music app for easy listening.
Ivan has a list of nine songs by Depeche Mode. Each song has a title and duration (in minutes, with decimals):
```python
violator_songs = [
    ['World in My Eyes', 4.86],
    ['Sweetest Perfection', 4.43],
    ['Personal Jesus', 4.56],
    ['Halo', 4.9],
    ['Waiting for the Night', 6.07],
    ['Enjoy the Silence', 4.20],
    ['Policy of Truth', 4.76],
    ['Blue Dress', 4.29],
    ['Clean', 5.83]
]
```
## âœ… What You Need to Do
Write a program that:

- Asks the user how many songs they want to select from the list.

- Then asks for the titles of those songs (one by one).

- Calculates and prints the total duration of the selected songs.

## ðŸ§ª Example
```markdown
How many songs to select? 3
Title of song 1: Halo
Title of song 2: Enjoy the Silence
Title of song 3: Clean

Total playlist duration: 14.93 minutes
```
## âœ… Requirements
- Correctly calculate the total duration.

- Input prompts must be clear and follow the example.

- Output format must exactly match the example.

- Use meaningful variable names (no random letters).

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered
- Lists and list access

- User input handling

- Summation of numerical data

- Formatting output

Tune your playlist perfectly! ðŸŽ§ðŸ”¥
