# Task 2: Unique Merge of Sorted Lists
## ✨ What’s the point?
Imagine you’re working on a data pipeline where multiple sorted lists are coming in from different sources. These lists might have duplicate numbers, and your job is to merge them into a single sorted list…
…without any duplicates. Clean and tidy. Just how we like our data. 😌

## 🧠 What we need to do:
You're given two sorted lists of integers. You need to merge them into one sorted list with all duplicates removed.

## 🧪 Example:
```python
list1 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
list2 = [2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10]
merged = merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2)
print(merged)
```
## 🧾 Expected Output
```SQL
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```
## 🧟‍♂️ P.S.:
If you think this sounds easy, wait till you forget to remove duplicates and the system yells at you for "data integrity issues." Better do it right from the start 😅

## ✅ Requirements
- Make it readable.

- Use good variable names (no more a, b, c).

- Keep it short and sweet — no overcomplicated stuff.

## 📌 Topics Covered
- Merging lists

- Removing duplicates

- Sorting elements

- Writing clean and readable Python code

- Handling edge cases (like empty lists or lots of duplicates)

Happy coding 🧹📊
